enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web
in the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for
ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and
HTML.</p>
</abstract>
<status>
<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
other interested parties and has been endorsed by the
Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
document and may be used as reference material or cited
as a normative reference from another document. W3C's
role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention
to the specification and to promote its widespread
deployment. This enhances the functionality and
interoperability of the Web.</p>
<p>
This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing,
widely used international text processing standard (Standard
Generalized Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and
corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.  It is a product of the W3C
XML Activity, details of which can be found at <loc

<sitem>1997-12-03 : CMSMcQ : yet further changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : TB : further changes (see TB to XML WG,
2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and
comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
change expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan Connolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),
add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee et al.),
move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fragment identifiers are
NOT part of the URI formally speaking, and are NOT legal in 
system identifiers (processor 'may' signal an error).
Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOTber 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,
modify definition of PCData to make bar on msc grammatical,
change grammar's handling of internal subset (drop non-terminal markupdecls),
change definition of includeSect to allow conditional sections,
add integral-declaration constraint on internal subset,
drop misleading / dangerous sentence about relationship of
entities with system storage objects,
change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normable by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic changes,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for ignored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs finding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating to element content (?).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft:
Add text for draconian error handling (introduce
the term Fatal Error).
RE deleta est (changing wording from 
original announcement to restrict the requirement to validating
parsers).
Tag definition of validating processor and link to it.
Add colon as name character.
Change def of %operator.
Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on
well-formed:   Webster's Second hyphenates it, and that's enough
for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31 : Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, ch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : CMSMcQ : correct as many reported errors as possible.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Fix / complete section on names, characters.
Add sections on parameter entities, conditional sections.
Still to do:  Add compatibility note on deterministic content models.
Finish stylistic revision.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-31 : TB : Add Entity Handling section</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-30 : TB : Clean up term &amp; termdef.  Slip in
ERB decision re EMPTY.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-28 : TB : Change DTD.  Implement some of Michael's
suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments are /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have val correct a few productions.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10/11 : CMSMcQ : various maintenance, stylistic, and
organizational changes:
Replace a few literals with xmlpio and
pic entities, to make them consistent and ensure we can change pic
reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of
delimiter escaping.
Streamline discussion of doctype decl syntax.
Drop old section of 'PI syntax' for doctype decl, and add
section on partial-DTD summary PIs to end of Logical Structures
section.
Revise DSD syntax section to use Tim's subset-in-a-PI
mechanism.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10 : TB : eliminate name recognizers (and more?)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : revise for style, consistency through 2.3
(Characters)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : re-unite everything for convenience,
at least temporarily, and revise quickly</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : first major homogenization pass</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : turn "current" attribute on div type into 
CDATA</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-02 : TB : remould into skeleton + entities</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-30 : CMSMcQ : add a few more sections prior to exchange
                            with Tim.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-20 : CMSMcQ : finish transcribing notes.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-19 : CMSMcQ : begin transcribing notes for draft.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-13 : CMSMcQ : made outline from notes of 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->

The document type declaration can point to an external subset (a
special kind of 
<termref def='dt-extent'>external entity</termref>) containing markup
declarations, or can 
contain the markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or can do
both.   
The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken
together.</termdef>

<div2 id='sec-white-space'>
<head>White Space Handling</head>

<p>In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines, denoted by the nonterminal 
<nt def='NT-S'>S</nt> in this specification) tr example in poetry and
source code.</p>
<p>An <termref def='dt-xml-proc'>XML processor</termref> 
must always pass all characters in a document that are not
markup through to the application.   A <termref def='dt-validating'>
validating XML processor</termref> must also inform the application
which  of these characters constitute white space appearing
in <termref def="dt-elemcontent">element content</termref>.
</p>
<p>A special <termref def='dt-attr'>attribute</termref> 
named <kw>xml:space</kw> may be attached to an element
to signal an intention that in that element,
white space should be preserved by applications.
In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be 
<termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref> if it is used.
When declared, it mus"Codes 
for the representation of names of countries."
If the first 
subcode consists of more than two letters, it must be
a subcode for the language in question registered with IANA,
unless the <nt def='NT-Langcode'>Langcode</nt> begins with the prefix 
"<code>x-</code>" or
"<code>X-</code>". </p>
<p>It is customary to give the language code in lower case, and
the country code (if any) in upper case.
Note that these values, unlike other names in XML documents,
are case insensitive.</p>
<p>For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<p xml:lang="en">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>

<div2 id='safe-behavior'>
<head>Using XML Processors</head>
<p>The behavior of a validating XML processor is highly predictable; it
must read every piece of a document and report all well-formedness and
validity violations.
Less is required of a non-validating processor; it need not read any
part of the document other than the document entity.
This has two effects that may be important to users of XML processors:
<ulist>
<item><p>Certain well-formedness errors, specifically those that require
reading external entities, may not be detected by a non-validating processor.
Examples include the constraints entitled 
<titleref href='wf-entdeclared'>Entity Declared</titleref>, 
<titleref href='wf-textent'>Parsed Entity</titleref>, and
<titleref href='wf-norecursion'>No Recursion</titleref>, as well
as some of the cases described as
<titleref href='forbidden'>forbidden</titleref> in 
<specref ref='entproc'/>.</p></item>
<item><p>The information passed from the processor to the application may
vary, depending on whether the processor reads
parameter and external entities.
For example, a non-validating processor may not 
<titleref href='AVNormalize'>normalize</titleref> attribute values,
<titleref href='included'>include</titleref> the replacement text of 
internal entities, or supply 
<titleref href='sec-attr-defaults'>default attribute values</titleref>,
where doing so depends on having read declarations in 
external or parameter entities.</p></item>
</ulist>
</p>
<p>For maximum reliability in interoperating between different XML
processors, applications which use non-validating processors should not 
rely on any behaviors not required of such processors.
Applications which require facilities such as the use of default
attributes or internal entities which are declared in external
entities should use validating XML processors.</p>

These symbols may be combined to match more complex patteL encoding declaration functions as an internal label on each
entity, indicating which character encoding is in use.  Before an XML
processor can read the internal label, however, it apparently has to
know what character encoding is in use&mdash;which is what the internal label
is trying to indicate.  In the general case, this is a hopeless
situation. It is not entirely hopeless in XML, however, because XML
limits the general case in two ways:  each implementation is assumed
to support only a  finite set of character encodings, and the XML
encoding declaration is restricted in position and content in order to
make it feasible to autodetect the character encoding in use in each
entity in normal cases.  Also, in many cases other sources of information
are available in addition to the XML data stream itself.  
Two cases may be distinguished, 
depending on whether the XML entity is presented to the
processor without, or with, any accompanying
(external) information.  We consider the first case first.
</p>
<p>
Because each XML entity not in UTF-8 or UTF-16 format <emph>must</emph>
begin with an XML encoding declaration, in which the first  characters
must be '<code>&lt;?xml</code>', any conforming processor can detect,
after two to four octets of input, which of the following cases apply. 
In reading this list, it may help to know that in UCS-4, '&lt;' is
"<code>#x0000003C</code>" and '?' is "<code>#x0000003F</code>", and the Byte
Order Mark required of UTF-16 data streams is "<code>#xFEFF</code>".</p>

Shift-JIS, EUC, or any other 7-bit, 8-bit, or mixed-width encoding
which ensures that the characters of ASCII have their normal positions,
width,
and values; the actual encoding declaration must be read to 
detect which of these applies, but since all of these encodings
use the same bit patterns for the ASCII characters, the encoding 
declaration itself may be read reliably
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p><code>4C 6F A7 94</code>: EBCDIC (in some flavor; the full

declaration and parse the character-encoding identifier, which is
still necessary to distinguish the individual members of each family
of encodings (e.g. to tell  UTF-8 from 8859, and the parts of 8859
from each other, or to distinguish the specific EBCDIC code page in
use, and so on).
</p>
<p>
Because the contents of the encoding declaration are restricted to
ASCII characters, a processor can reliably read the entire encoding
declaration as soon as it has detected which family of encodings is in
use.  Since in practice, all widely used character encodings fall into
one of the categories above, the XML encoding declaration allows
reasonably reliable in-band labeling of character encodings, even when
external sources of information at the operating-system or
transport-protocol level are unreliable.
</p>
<p>
Once the processor has detected the character encoding in use, it can
act appropriately, whether by invoking a separate input routine for
each case, or by calling the proper conversion function on each
character of input. 
</p>
<p>
Like any self-labeling system, the XML encoding declaration will not
work if any software changes the entity's character set or encoding
without updating the encoding declaration.  Imsome file systems and some network
protocols.
When multiple sources of information are available,

their relative
priority and the preferred method of handling conflict should be
specified as part of the higher-level protocol used to deliver XML.
Rules for the relative priority of the internal label and the
MIME-type label in an external header, for example, should be part of the
RFC document defining the text/xml and application/xml MIME types. In
the interests of interoperability, however, the following rules
are recommended.
<ulist>
<item><p>If an XML entity is in a file, the Byte-Order Mark
and encoding-declaration PI are used (if present) to determine the
character encoding.  All other heuristics and sources of information
are solely for error recovery.ry.
</p></item>
<item><p>If an XML entity is delivered 
with a
MIME type of application/xml, then the Byte-Order Mark and
encoding-declaration PI are used (if present) to determine the
character encoding.  All other heuristics and sources of
information are solely for error recovery.
</p></item>
</ulist>
These rules apply only in the absence of protocol-level documentation;
in particular, when the MIME types text/xml and application/xml are
defined, the recommendations of the relevant RFC will supersede

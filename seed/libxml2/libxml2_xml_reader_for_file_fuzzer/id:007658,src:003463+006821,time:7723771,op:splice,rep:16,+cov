		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is used here, is an explicit relationship between two or more data objects or portions of data objects. This specification is concerned with the syntax used to assert link existence and describe link characteristics. Implicit (unasserted) relationships, for example that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an Hd has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of it-&iso6.doc.date; --s ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in so/p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><p>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link itself. For example, traveral of <code>A</code> links normally replaces the current view, perhaps with a user option to open a new window.</p></item>
				<item><p>The link goes to only one destination (although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destination).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of thest go beyond each of these specific characteristics, thus providing features previously available mostly in dedicated hypermedia systems.

<div2>
	<head>Notation</head>
	<p>The formal grammar for <termref def="dt-lZcator">locators</termref> is given using a simple Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) location, as described in <xspecref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-notation">the XML specification</xspecref>.</p>

<div1 id="addressing"><?Pub Dtl?>
	<head>Locator Syntax</head>
	<p>The locator for a <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref> is typically provided by means of a Uniform Resource Identifier, or URI. XPointers can be used in cosion of queries from the previous paragraph, due to contention within the WG. bent -->
	<p>A locator generally contains a URI, aer</emph>, with the query interpreted by the host providing the indicated resource, and the interpretation of the fragment identifier dependent on the data type of the indicated resource.</p>
	<!--Is there some restriction on URNs having Pueries and/or fragment identifiers?  Since these RFCs don't mention URIs explicitly, should the wording here lead from URLs to URIs more explicitly? -elm-->
	<p>In order to locate XML documents and portions of documents, a locator value may contain either a <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt"> URI</xtermref> or a fragment identifier, or both. Any fragment identifier for pointing into XML must be an <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr#dt-xpointer"> XPointer</xtermref>.</p>
	<p>Special syntax may be used to request the use of particular processing models in accessing the locator's resource. This is designed to reflect th the resource which an entire locator serves to locate.</termdef> The following rules apply:
		<ulist>
			<item>
				<p><termdef id="dt-containing-resource" term="Containing Resource">		  The URI, if provided, locates a resource called the <term>containing resource</term>.</termdef></p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>If the URI is not provided, the containing resource is considered to be the document in which theÿÿÿking element is contained. 
				</p></item>
			<item>
				<p><termdef id="dt-sub-resource" term="Sub-Resource">If an XPointer				  is provided, the designated resource is a <term>sub-resource</term>
				of the containing resource; otherwise the designated resource is the
				containing resource.</termdef></p>
			</item>
			<!--Is this now incorrect, given the nature of the switch from here() to origin()? -elm 
			Oy, yes, i think so. it will require some fun wording, though, so i haven't fixed it yet here -sjd-->
			<item>
				<p>If the <nt def="nt-connector">Connector</nt> is followed directly by a dation - bent -->
			<item>
				<p>If the connector is "<code>#</code>", this signals an intent that the containing resource is to be fetched as a whole from the host that provides it, and that the XPointer processing to extract the sub-resource
				is to be performed on the client, that is to say on the same system where the linking element is recognized and processed.</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>If the connector is "<code>|</code>", no intent is signaled as to what processing model is to be used to go about accessing the designated resource.</p>
			</item>
		</ulist>
	</p>
	<p>Note that the definition of a URI includes an optional query component. </p>
	<p>In the case where the URI contains a query (to be interpreted by the server), information providers and authors of server software are urged to use queries as follows: 
		<scrap id="querysyntax" lang="ebnf">
			<head>Query</head>
			<prod id="nt-query">
				<lhs>Query</lhs><rhs>'XML-XPTR=' (<xnt href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr"> XPointer</xnt> | <xion - bent -->

<div1><?Pub Dtl?>
	<head>Link Recognition</head>
	<p>The existence of a <termref def="dt-link">link</tercation software in order to provide appropriate display and behavior. There are several ways link recognition could be accomplished: for example, reserving element type names, reserving attributes names, leaving the matter of recognition entirely up to stylesheets and application software, or using the XLink <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">namespace</xtermref> to specify element names and attribute names that would be recognized by namespace and XLink-aware processors. Using element and variety of links it may represent. These attributes define four main concepts: locators, arcs, behaviors, and semantics. <emph>Locators</emph> define where the actual resource is located. <emph>Arcs</emph> define the traversal of links. Where does the link come from? Where does it go to? All this information can e stored in the arc attributes. <emph>Behaviors</emph> define how the link is activated, and what the application should do with the resource being linked to. <emph>Semantics</emph> define useful information that the application may use, and enables the link for such specalized targets as constricted devices and accessibility software.</p>
	
	<div2 id="link-locators">
		<head>Locator Attributes</head>
		<p>The only locator attribute at this time is <code>href</code>. This attribute must contain either a string in the form of a URI that defines the remote resource being linked to, a string containing a fragment identifier that links to a local resource, or a string containing a URI with a fragment identifier concacenated onto it.</p>
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-arcs">
		<head>Arc Attributes</head>
		<p>Arcs contain two attributes, <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>. The <code>from</code> attribute may contain a string containing the content of a <code>role</code> attribute from the resource being linked from. The purpose of the <code>from</code> attribute is to define where this link is being actuated from.</p>
		<p>The <code>to</code> attribute may contain a string containing the contATTLIST ident of<div2 id="link-behaviors">
		<head>Behavior Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with behavior: <code>show</code> and <code>actuate</code>. The <code>show</code> attribute defines how the remote resource is to be revealed to the user.de>parsed</code> option, relating directly to the XML concept of a parsed entity, indicates that the content should be integrated into the document from which the link was actuated. The <code>replace</code> option is the one most commonly seen on the World Wide Web, where the document being linked from is entirely replaced by the object being linked to.</p>
		<p>The <code>actuate</code> attribute defines how the link is initiated. It has two options: <code>user</code> and <code>auto</code>. The <code>user</code> option indicates that the link must be initiated by some sort of human-initiated selection, such as clicking on an HTML anchor. The <code>auto</code> option indicates that the link is automatically initiated when the application deems that the user has reached the link. It then follows the behavior set out in the <code>show</code> option.</p>
		<!-- Something should be put here in terms of an example. Idea: "A" link versus automatically updating encyclopedia. -bent -->
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-semantics">
		<head>Semantic Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with semantics, <code>role</code> and <code>title</code>. The <code>role</code> attribute is a generic string used to describe the function of the link's content. For example, a poem might have a link with a <code>role="stanza"</code>. The <code>role</code> is also used as an identifier for the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> attributes of arcs.</p>
		<p>The <code>title</code> attribute is designed to provide human-reada  role           CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    title          CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    show           (new|parsed|replace)  	"replace"
    actuate        (user|auto) 				"user"
&gt;</eg>
	And here is how to make an arbitrary element into a simple link.
	<eg>&lt;!ELEMENT xlink:simple ANY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST foo
	xlink:type     (simple|extended|locator|arc) #FIXED "simple"		
    xlink:href     CDATA    				#REQUIRED
    xlink:role     CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    xlink:title    CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    xlink:show     (new|parsed|replace)  	"replace"
    xlink:actuate  (user|auto) 				"user"
&gt;</eg>
	Here is how the first example might look in a document:
<eg>&lt;xlink:simple href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink" role="working draft" 
	title="The XLink Working Draft" k Working Draft.&lt;/foo&gt;</eg>
	Alternately, a simple link could be as terse as this:
<eg>&lt;foo xlink:href="#stanza1"&gt;The First Stanza.&lt;/foo&gt;</eg>
	</p>
	<p>
	There are no constraints on the contents of a simple linking element. In
	the samplin its governing DTD.</p>
	<p>Note that it is meaningful to have an out-of-line simple link, although
	such links are uncommon. They are called "one-ended" and are typically used
	to associate discrete semantic properties with locations. The properties might
	be expressed by attributes on the link, the link's element type name, or in
	some other way, and are not considered full-fledged resources of the link.
	Most out-of-line links are extended links, as these have a far wider range
	of uses.</p>
</div2>

<div2 id="extended-link">
<head>Extended Links</head>
	<p><termdef id="dt-extendedlink" term="Extended Link">An <term>extended link</term> differs from a simple link in that it can connect any number of resources, not just one local resource (optionally)    one remote resource, and in that extended links are more often out-of-line than simple links.</termdef></p>
	<p>These additional capabilities of extended links are required for:  
		<ulist>
			<item>
				<p>Enabling outgoing links in documents that cannot be modified to add an inline link</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>Creating links to and from resources in formats with no native support for embedded links (such as most multimedia formats)</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>Applying and filtering sets of rg element for an extended link contains a series of <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-parentchild">child elements</xtermref> that serve as locators and arcs. Because an extended link can have more than one remote resource, it separates out linking itself from the mechanisms used to locate each resource (whereas a simple link combines the two).</p>
	<p>The <code>xlink:type</code> attribute value for an extended link must be <code> extended</code>, if the link is being instantiated on an arbitrary element. Note that extended links introduce variants of the <code>show</code> and <code>actuate</code> behavior attributes. These attributes, the <code>showdefault</code> and <code>actuatedefault</code> define the same behavior as their counterparts. However, in this case, they are considered to define the default behavior for all the linking elements that they contain.</p>
	<p>However, when a linking element within an extended link has a <code>show</code> or <code>actuate</code> attribute of its own, that attribute overrides the defaults set on the extended linking element.</p>
	<p>The extended linking element itself retains those attributes relevant to the link as a whole, and to its local resource if any. Following are two sample declaration for an extended link. The first is an example of the explicit XLink extended link:
	
<eg>&lt;!ELEMENT xlink:extended ((xlink:arc | xlink:locator)*)>
&lt;!ATTLIST xlink:extended
	role           CDATA    				#IMPLIED
	title          CDATA    				#IMPLIED
	showdefault    (new|parsed|replace)    	#IMPLIED 
    actuatedefault (user|auto) 				#IMPLIED &gt;</eg>

	The second is an example of an arbitrary element being used an extended link:

<eg>&lt;!ELEMENT foo ((xlink:aUc | xlink:locator)*)>
&lt;!ATTLIST foo
	xlink:type ms to XLink if it interprets XLink-conforming elements
according to all required semantics prescribed by this specification and,
for any optional semantics it chooses to support, supports them in the way
prescribed. <!--If/when we split out the XLinkfunctionality
(e.g. inline links and out-of-line links), the
conformance language will have to address the different
levels of support. -elm--> </p>

	<!-- Version 1.3
	This is the DTD of the XML-format kanji file combining information from
	the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files. It is intended to be largely self-
	documenting, with each field being accompanied by an explanatory
	comment.

	The file covers the following kanji:
	(a) the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208;
	(b) the 5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212;
	(c) the 3,625 kanji from JIS X 0213 as follows:
		(i) the 2,741 kanji which are also in JIS X 0212 have
		JIS X 0213 code-points (kuten) added to the existing entry;
		(ii) the 884 "new" kanji have new entries.

	At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
	with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
	equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.

	The KANJIDIC documentation should also be read for additional 
	information about the information in the file.

	<div1><?Pub Dtl?>
		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is used here, is an explicit relationship between two or more data objects or portions of data objects. This specification is concerned with the syntax used to assert link existence and describe link characteristics. Implicit (unasserted) relationships, for example that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an Hd has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of its ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in some document)</p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><p>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link itself. For example, traveral of <code>A</code> links normally replaces the current view, perhaps with a user option to open a new window.</p></item>
				<item><p>The link goes to only one destination (although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destination).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of these assumptions also limits the range of hypertext functionality. The linking model defined here provides ways to create links that go beyond each of these specific characteristics, thus providing features previously available mostly in dedicated hypermedia systems.
		</p>

<div2>
	<head>Origin and Goals</head>
	<p>Following is a summary of the design principles governing XLink:
		<olist>
			<item><p>XLink must be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. </p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be usable by a wide variety of link usage domains and classes of linking application software.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must support HTML 4.0 linking constructs.</p></item>
			<item><p>The XLink expression language must be XML.</p></item>
			<item><p>The XLink design must be formal, concise, and illustrative.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink| musX be human-readable and human-writable.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLinks may reside within or outside the documents in which the
			participating resources reside. </p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must represent the abstract structure and significance of links.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be feasible to implement.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be informed by knowledge of established hypermedia systems and standards.</p></item>
		</olist>
	</p>
</div2>
<!--Changed the list of requirements to reflect current XLink requirements
document. bent-->

<div2>
	<head>Relationship to Existing Standards</head>
	<p>Three standards have been especially influential:
		<ulist>
			<item><p><emph>HTML:</emph> Defines several SGML element types that represent links.</p></item>
			<item><p><emph>HyTime:</emph> Defines inline and out-of-line link structures and some semantic features, including traversal control and presentation of objects. <!--Changed from "placement of objects into a display or other space" -elm-->
			</p></item>
			<item><p><emph>Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines (TEI P3):</emph> Provides structures for creating links, aggregate objects, and link collections out of them.</p></item>
		</ulist>
	</p>
	<p>Many other linking systems have also informed this design, especially Dexter, FRESS, MicroCosm, and InterMedia.</p>
</div2>

<div2>
	<head>Terminology</head>
	<p>The following basic terms apply in this document. <!--<IMG

		<glist>
			<gitem>
			<label><termdef id="dt-arc" term="Arc">arc</termdef></label>
			<def><p>A symbolic representation of traversal behavior in links, especially the direction, context and timing of traversal.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-eltree" term="Element Tree">element tree</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A representation of the relevant structure specified by the tags and attributes in an XML document, based on "groves" as defined in the ISO DSSSL standard. </p></def>

			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-inline" term="In-Line Link">inline link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>Abstractly, a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> which serves as one of its own <termref def="dt-resource">resources</termref>. Concretely, a link where the content of the <termref def="dt-linkel">linking	element</termref> serves as a <termref def="dt-particip-resource">participating resource</termref>.
				HTML <code>A</code>, HyTime <code>clink</code>, and TEI	<code>XREF</code>
				are all inline links.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-link" term="Link">link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>An explicit relationship between two or more data objects or portions of data objects.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-linkel" term="Linking Element">linking element </termdef></label>

			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-local-resource" term="Local Resource">local resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>The content of an <termref def="dt-inline">inline</termref>linking element. Note that the content of the linking element could be explicitly pointed to by means of a regular <termref def="dt-locator">locator</termref> in the same linking element, in which case the resource is considered <termref def="dt-remote-resource"> remote</termref>, not local.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-locator" term="Locator">locator</termdef> </label>
				<def><p>Data, provided as part of a link, which identifies a

			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-multidir" term="Multi-Directional Link">multidirectional link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> whose <termref def="dt-traversal"> traversal</termref> can be initiated from more than one of its <termref	def="dt-particip-resource"> participating resources</termref>. Note that being able to "go back" after following a one-directional link does not make the link multidirectional.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-outofline" term="Out-of-line Link">out-of-line link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> whose content does not serve as one of the link's <termref def="dt-particip-resource">participating resources </termref>. Such links 						presuppose a notion like <termref def="dt-xlg">extended link groups</termref>, which instruct application software where to look for links. Out-of-line links are generally required for supporting multidirectional <termref def="dt-traversal">traversal</termref> and for allowing read-only resources to have outgoing links.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-parsedq" term="Parsed">parsed</termdef></label> <def><p>In the context of link behavior, a parsed link is any link			whose content is transcluded into the document where the link originated. The	use of the term "parsed" directly refers to the concept in XML of a
				parsed entity.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-particip-resource" term="Participating Resource"> participating resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref> that belongs to a link. All resources are potential contributors to a link; participating	resources are the actual contributors to a particular link.</p></def>

	<head>Locator Syntax</head>
	<p>The locator for a <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref> is typically provided by means of a Uniform Resource Identifier, or URI. XPointers can be used in conjunction with the URI structure, as fragment identifiers, to specify a more precise sub-resource. </p>
	<!-- Removed the discussion of queries from the previous paragraph, due to contention within the WG. bent -->
	<p>A locator generally contains a URI, as described in IETF RFCs <bibref ref="rfc1738"/> and <bibref ref="rfc1808"/>. As these RFCs state, the URI may include a trailing <emph>query</emph> (marked by a leading "<code>?</code>"), and be followed by a "<code>#</code>" and a <emph>fragment identifier</emph>, with the query interpreted by the host providing the indicated resource, and the interpretation of the fragment identifier dependent on the data type of the indicated resource.</p>
	<!--Is there some restriction on URNs having queries and/or fragment identifiers?  Since these RFCs don't mention URIs explicitly, should the wording here lead from URLs to URIs more explicitly? -elm-->
	<p>In order to locate XML documents and portions of documents, a locator value may contain either a <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt"> URI</xtermref> or a fragment identifier, or both. Any fragment identifier for pointing into XML must be an <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr#dt-xpointer"> XPointer</xtermref>.</p>
	<p>Special syntax may be used to request the use of particular processing models in accessing the locator's resource. This is designed to reflect the realities of network operation, where it may or may not be desirable to exercise fine control over the distribution of work between local and remote processors.

	<head>Link Recognition</head>
	<p>The existence of a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> is asserted by a <termref def="dt-linkel">linking element</termref>. Linking elements must be recognized reliably by application software in order to provide appropriate display and behavior. There are several ways link recognition could be accomplished: for example, reserving element type names, reserving attributes names, leaving the matter of recognition entirely up to stylesheets and application software, or using the XLink <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">namespace</xtermref> to specify element names and attribute names that would be recognized by namespace and XLink-aware processors. Using element and attribute names within the XLink namespace provides a balance between giving users control of their own markup language design and keeping the identification of linking elements simple and unambiguous.</p>
	<p>The two approaches to identifying linking elements are relatively simple to implement. For example, here's how the HTML <code>A</code> element would be declared using attributes within the XLink namespace, and then how an element within the XLink namespace might do the same:
		<eg>&lt;A xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink/"
xlink:title="The Xlink Working Draft"&gt;The XLink Working Draft.&lt;/A&gt;</ef>
		<eg>&lt;xlink:simple href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink/"
title="The XLink Working Draft"&gt;The XLink Working Draft&lt;/xlink:simple&gt;</eg>
	Any arbitrary element can be made into an XLink by using the <code>xlink:type</code> attribute. And, of course, the explicit XLink elements may be used, as well. This document will go on to describe the linking attributes that are associated with linking elements. It may be assumed by the reader that these attributes would require the <code>xlink</code> namespace prefix if they existed within an arbitrary element, or that they may be used directly if they exist within an explicit Xlink element.</p>
		<!-- heavily modified this section to accomodate namespace-aware link recognition - bent -->
</div1>

<!-- Rewrote this entire section. - bent -->
<div1>
	<head>Linking Attributes</head>
	<p>XLink has several attributes associated with the variety of links it may represent. These attributes define four main concepts: locators, arcs, behaviors, and semantics. <emph>Locators</emph> define where the actual resource is located. <emph>Arcs</emph> define the traversal of links. Where does the link come from? Where does it go to? All this information can be stored in the arc attributes. <emph>Behaviors</emph> define how the link is activated, and what the application should do with the resource being linked to. <emph>Semantics</emph> define useful information that the application may use, and enables the link for such specalized targets as constricted devices and accessibility software.</p>
	
	<div2 id="link-locators">
		<head>Locator Attributes</head>
		<p>The only locator attribute at this time is <code>href</code>. This attribute must contain either a string in the form of a URI that defines the remote resource being linked to, a string containing a fragment identifier that links to a local resource, or a string containing a URI with a fragment identifier concacenated onto it.</p>
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-arcs">
		<head>Arc Attributes</head>
		<p>Arcs contain two attributes, <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>. The <code>from</code> attribute may contain a string containing the content of a <code>role</code> attribute from the resource being linked from. The purpose of the <ode>from</code> attribute is to define where this link is being actuated from.</p>
		<p>The <code>to</code> attribute may contain a string containing the contATTLIST ident of a <code>role</code> attribute from the resource being linked to. The purpose of the <code>to</code> attribute is to define where this link traverses to.</p>
		<p>The application may use this information in a number of ways, especially in a complex hypertext system, but it is mainly useful in providing context for application behavior.</p>
		<!-- I'm at a loss as to how to describe arcs more clearly than this. I don't want to devolve into discussions of directed graphs and n-ary links. -bent -->
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-behaviors">
		<head>Behavior Attributes</head>
		<O>There are two attributes associated with behavior: <code>show</code> and <code>actuate</code>. The <code>show</code> attribute defines how the remote resource is to be revealed to the user. It has three options: <code>new</code>, <code>parsed</code>, and <code>replace</code>. The <code>new</code> option indicates that the remote resource should be shown in a new window (or other device context) without replacing the previous content. The <code>parsed</code> option, relating directly to the XML concept of a parsed entity, indicates that the content should be integrated into the document from which the link was actuated. The <code>replace</code> option is the one most commonly seen on the World Wide Web, where the document being linked from is entirely replaced by the object being linked to.</p>
		<p>The <code>actuate</code> attribute defines how the link is initiated. It has two options: <code>user</code> and <code>auto</code>. The <code>user</code> option indicates that the link must be initiated by some sort of human-initiated selection, such as clicking on an HTML anchor. The <code>auto</code> option indicates that the link is automatically initiated when the application deems that the user has reached the link. It then follows the behavior set out in the <code>show</code> option.</p>
		<!-- Something should be put here in terms of an example. Idea: "A" link versus automatically updating encyclopedia. -bent -->
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-semantics">
		<head>Semantic Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with semantics, <code>role</code> and <code>title</code>. The <code>role</code> attribute is a generic string used to describe the function of the link's content. For example, a poem might have a link with a <code>role="stanza"</code>. The <code>role</code> is also used as an identifier for the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> attributes of arcs.</p>
		<p>The <code>title</code> attribute is designed to provide human-readable text describing the link. It is very useful for those who have text-based applications, whether that be due to a constricted device that cannot display the link's content, or if it's being read by an application to a visually-impaired user, or if it's being used to create a table of links. The <code>title</code> attribute contains a simple, descriptive string.</p>
	</div2>
</div1>

<div1 id="linking-elements">
	<head>Linking Elements</head>
	<p>There are several kinds of linking elements in XLink: <code>simple</code> links, <code>locators</code>, <code>arcs</code>, and <code>extended</code> links. These elements may be instantiated via element declarations from the XLink namespace, or they may be instantiated via attribute declarations from the XLink namespace. Both kinds of instantiation are described in the definition of each linking element.</p>
	<p>The <code>simple</code> link is used to declare a link that approximates the functionality of the HTML <code>A</code> element. It has, however, a few added features to increase its value, including the potential declaration of semantics and behavior. The <code>locator</code> elements are used to define the resource being linked to. Some links may contain multiple locators, representing a choice of potential links to be traversed. The <code>arcs</code> are used to define the traversal semantics of the link. Finally, an <code>extended</code> linking element differs from a simple link in that it can connect any number of resources, not just one local resource (optionally) and one remote resource, and in that extended links are more often out-of-line than simple links.</p>

<div2 id="simple-links">
	<head>Simple Links</head>
	<p id="dt-simplelink"><termdef id="dt-simpleline" term="Simple Link"><term>Simple links</term> can be used for purposes that approximate the functionality of a basic HTML <code>A</code> link, but they can also support a limited amount of additional functionality. Simple links have only one locator and thus, for convenience, combine the functions of a linking element and a locator into a single element.</termdef> As a result of this combination, the simple linking element offers both a locator attribute and all the behavior and semantic attributes.</p>
	<p>The following are two examples of linking elements, each showing all the possible attributes that can be associated with a simple link. Here is the explicit XLink simple linking element.
	<eg>&lt;!ELEMENT xlink:simple ANY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST xlink:slink
    href           CDATA    				#REQUIRED
    role           CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    title          CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    show           (new|parsed|replace)  	"replace"
    actuate        (user|auto) 				"user"
&gt;</eg>
	And here is how to make an arbitrary element into a simple link.
	<eg>&lt;!ELEMENT xlink:simple ANY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST foo
	xlink:type     (simple|extended|locator|arc) #FIXED "simple"		
    xlink:href     CDATA    				#REQUIRED
    xlink:role     CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    xlink:title    CDATA    				#IMPLIED
    xlink:show     (new|parsed|replace)  	"replace"
    xlink:actuate  (user|auto) 				"user"
&gt;</eg>
	Here is how the first example might look in a document:
<eg>&lt;xlink:simple href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink" role="working draft" 
	title="The XLink Working Draft" show="replace" actuate="user"&gt;

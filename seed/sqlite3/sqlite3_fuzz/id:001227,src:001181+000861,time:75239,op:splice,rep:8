# The following block of tests - e_select-1.4.* - test that the description
# of cartesian joins in the SELECT documentation is consistent with SQLite.
# In doing so, we test the following three requirements as a side-effect:
#
# EVIDENCE-OF: R-49872-03192 If the join-operator is "CROSS JOIN",
# "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" or a comma (",") and there is no ON or USING
# clause, then the result of the join is simply the cartesian product of
# the left and right-hand datasets.
#
#    The tests are built on this assertion. Really, they test that the output
#    of a CROSS JOIN, JOIN, INNER JOIN or "," join matches the expected result
#    of calculating the cartesian product of the left and right-hand datasets. 
#
# EVIDENCE-OF: R-46256-57243 There is no difference between the "INNER
# JOIN", "JOIN" and "," join operators.
#
# EVIDENCE-OF: R-25071-21202 The "CROSS JOIN" join operator produces the
# same result as the "INNER JOIN", "JOIN" and "," operators
#
#    All tests are run 4 times, with the only difference in each run being
#    which of the 4 equivalent cartesian product join operators are used.
#    Since the output data is the same in all cases, we consider that this
#    qualifies as testing the two statements above.

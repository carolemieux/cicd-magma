# tosem-results

This folder contains _processed_ results used to generate the tables, plots, and numbers 
in the "Directed or Undirected: Investigating Fuzzing Strategies in a CI/CD Setup" paper.

These results are created from the raw results using scripts in the `tosem-scripts` folder.

## Directory Structure

```
aux-data-results: contains auxiliary data analyzed in section 4.5 in the paper, 
                  including # of execs, true fuzz time, total and target coverage.
    - {fuzzer}_execs_and_fuzz_time.csv: 
            for each {fuzzer}, contains "fuzzer,benchmark,driver,run,execs_done,fuzz_time"
            i.e., the number of input executions (as measured by AFL) and true fuzz time
            on each benchmark + iteration (run) pair.
    - num_seeds.csv: 
            not used in the paper in the end; contains the seed directory and the
            number of seeds in that directory, as well as instructions for collecting that data
    - processed_coverage.csv:
            each line is of the form:
            {fuzzer},{benchmark},{cov_0},{cov_1},...,{cov_9}
            where cov_i is the total project coverage (in percent) on iteration i
    - processed_target_coverage.csv:
            each line is of the form:
            {fuzzer},{benchmark},{cov_0},{cov_1},...,{cov_9}
            where cov_i is the target functio coverage on iteration i; note the coverage
            here is between 0 and 1, i.e. needs to be multiplied by 100 to convert to percent
main-results: the main bug reaching/triggering results used in the paper
    - {fuzzer}.json:
      the results of $MAGMA_ROOT/tools/benchd/exp2json.py on the data generated by {fuzzer},
      i.e., a json containing the time to reach/trigger each bug on each iteration.
      These results have been adjusted to subtract 5s due to Magma off-by-poll error 
      (https://github.com/HexHive/magma/pull/179). 
      In detail the schema is as follows:
      {"results": 
            {"{fuzzer}": 
                 {"{benchmark}": {"{fuzz_driver}": 
                     {"{iteration}": {"reached": {"{bugid}": {reached_time}}
                                      "triggered": {"{bugid}": {triggered_time}}
                                      ... 
       }
       note that "triggered" key will be absent if an iteration did not trigger the bug,
       and the whole iteration result will be absent if no bugs reached/triggered.
    - {fuzzer}-inst.json:
      same as above except target build/instrumentation time is included in the 
      reached/triggered times.
    - {fuzzer}-inst.json:
      each line is of the form {benchmark},{instrumentation_time}, where instrumentation
      time is given in seconds and denotes the build/instrumentation time for {fuzzer}
      on {benchmark}
- survival-results: gives the bug survival times for each benchmark/fuzzer pair, as 
                    calculated by $MAGMA_ROOT/tools/benchd/survival_analysis.py, for
                    the main experiments (main-results)
   - {fuzzer}-survival.csv: CSV containing the following fields. 
       target,program,bug,fuzzer,survival_time_reached,survival_ci_reached,survival_time_triggered,survival_ci_triggered
       **These are the survival times WITHOUT considering build/instrumentation time**
   - {fuzzer}-inst-survival.csv: Same as above, except WITH considering build/
       instrumentation time. 
- sensitivity-results: same as main-results, but for the sensitivity experiments 
                       (Section 4.4 of the paper), i.e. patches with additional noise
- survival-sensitivity-results: the analogue of survival-results, but for sensitivity-results
                                rather than main-results.
- x-preparation-artifacts: artifacts from perparing the experiments, notably:
    - sensitivity-patches: the original target lists and augmented (i.e., noisy) 
      target lists passed to directed fuzzers in our sensitivity experiments.                
    - corpus_minimization_results.md: minimization results for the seed corpuses
      used in our experiments.

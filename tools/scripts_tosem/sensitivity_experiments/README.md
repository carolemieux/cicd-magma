# File Description

## Library and Pull Request Versions
The library versions are stored in `library_version.csv`. The 10 most recent pull requests urls are stored in the folder `pull_request_versions`. 

## Analysis of Patches, Pull Requests, and Commits
* Results in `pr_stats` are generated by the script `log_pr_patch_stats.sh`.
* Results in `library_commit_stats` are generated by the script `log_commit_history.sh`.
* Results in `patch_stats` are generated by the script `count_changes_in_patches.sh`

## Resulting Patches for Sensitivity Experiments

* `result_patches/targets` stores the newly added target lines of code generated by `process_commits.sh`. The targets for sqlite3 are processed differently in `select_targets_from_sqlite3.py` because the target lines of code for the binary are from a single compiled file instead of the original source files.
* `result_patches/original` stores the original files containing target lines of code for each benchmark.
* `result_patches/augmented` stores the original files containing target lines of code with the newly added target lines in `result_patches/targets`.

To use the augmented patches, one needs to manually replace the original patches stored in `targets/[benchmark_name]/patches/bugs`.
